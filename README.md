# pokemon-card-game
a simple pokemon card game made with PHP, CSS and HTML
it doesn't have a database, the data that is "saved" and used for the resources are storaged with sessions, a super global associative array that is native from PHP.
the project was made by a duo, where i was responsable for the backend, and my partner for the frontend.
functionalities: 
- define a user name for the player;
- its a two person game, but doesn't have the support to play directly, only to define your own user names.
